# 🚀 Spacecraft Reinforcement Learning Project  

## 🌍 Overview  
This project explores **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to autonomously land a spacecraft on a designated platform within a high-fidelity **Unreal Engine** simulation. Using RL algorithms, the agent learns optimal landing strategies under realistic physics conditions.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Simulation Platform:** Unreal Engine  
- **RL Algorithms:** SARSA, Policy Gradient  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Physics Engine:** Earth-standard gravity modeling  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Train an AI agent to **land a spacecraft autonomously**.  
- Compare different RL algorithms in terms of **reward efficiency and success rates**.  
- Optimize landing strategies to achieve **high success rates**.  

## 📊 Results  
| Algorithm         | Success Rate | Avg Reward | Episode Duration |
|------------------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| **Random**       | 6%          | -7943.03   | 53.16s           |
| **SARSA**        | 62%         | 3763.55    | 42.94s           |
| **Policy Gradient** | 89%     | 7679.34    | 21.58s           |
