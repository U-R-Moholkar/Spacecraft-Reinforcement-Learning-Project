# Spacecraft-Reinforcement-Learning-Project
This project explores **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to autonomously land a spacecraft on a designated platform within a high-fidelity **Unreal Engine** simulation. Using RL algorithms, the agent learns optimal landing strategies under realistic physics conditions.
